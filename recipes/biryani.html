        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-linedn plate to drain; set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Stir in yogurt, mint ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture become too dry and starts to stick
                to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes
                to reduce the gravy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>
            <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring it to a boil</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>
            <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish</li>
        </ol>
